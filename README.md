ORT
===

Run an Object Representation & Tracking (ORT) study in Matlab with minimal configuration. This is useful for developmental psychologists who want to examine infants' visual short term memory for objects and features.

Infants are familiarized to two objects hidden behind two occluders. After 5 familiarization trials, they receive 4 test trials: Baseline (BL), Surface Feature (SF), Spatiotemporal (ST), and Feature Binding (FB). These are adapted from Mareschel & Johnson (2003). In each test trial, the occluders are lifted to reveal two objects.

The sessions can be coded online using the keyboard, and all stimuli, timing options, and orders are easily configurable.

## How to use ORT

### Download ORT

* Download ort.m and the example "commfeat" study folder
* Create a folder in your Matlab directory and place these files inside of it
* Add this folder to your list of Matlab paths

### Create a new study

* Copy the example study folder, "commfeat", into a subfolder of your main ORT directory
* Modify `config.txt` with the configuration options for the new study using Excel. Save as a tab-delimited text file.
* Modify the stimuli in the `stimuli` sub-folder.

### Run a session

* Load Matlab
* Type `ort` in the command prompt
* Select your new study folder and click "Open"
* Follow on-screen prompts (e.g., enter the experimenter's name, infant's subject code, age, etc.)
* Code the infant's looking using the LeftArrow (for a right look), RightArrow (for a left look), and DownArrow (for a center look). Press the corresponding key when the infant is looking in that direction on the screen, and release the key when the baby stops looking.
* A log for the session will be created in the `logs` sub-folder
* A session file (with looking time results, participant details, and session metadata) will be created in the `sessions` sub-folder
